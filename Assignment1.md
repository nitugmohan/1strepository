The problem that this article is seeking to address is helping find displaced people after physical disasters. The current methods, including transport surveys and “manual registration of individuals at emergency-relief hubs,” are often unreliable. While these methods are valuable for record-keeping, they are inadequate at working efficiently during the aftermath of a disaster. Furthermore, these methods can exclude certain groups which can form a bias in the data. This bias creates a lower chance of survival and rescue for women, poor, rural, young, and elderly. These groups can also be misrepresented due to uncertain mobile phone ownership levels. The article clearly emphasizes that the method of tracking and using cell phone data is highly relevant and efficient. 
When focusing on Haiti, using the masts helped estimate the number of individuals displaced, the timing of major population movements, and the locations these people were traveling to. Because there was this data available, they were able to get a much more detailed analysis of where people were after the earthquake. These people are extremely vulnerable and finding them is an utmost priority. The geospatial data sets used by the authors includes 282 million calls from 2.8 million individual phones. The data was collected for a “period spanning six weeks before the disaster to five months after,” and the authors used simple assumptions and estimations to find information from the data. With this data, the authors investigated the use of mobile data for relief after physical disasters that displace large numbers of people. They hoped to answer if this approach of disaster management and response be operational?
But even tracking with cell phone data had its shortcomings. Though less prominent with this type of data collection, cell-phone data corresponds to the placement of masts throughout the area. Regions with higher populations are more likely to have a denser count of masts. Less developed regions have masts that are often spread “hundreds of kilometers apart.” This damages the protective security of individuals in rural zones. Furthermore, though cell phone ownership has increased, possession of a mobile phone is biased against “women, the poor, rural, young, and elderly.” This also impairs these group’s protective security. Along with that freedom, these group’s life expectancy, or the population's chances of living a long and healthy life, is a dimension of human development that can be impaired. 
The goal of reduced inequalities, specifically towards misrepresented groups, and industry, innovation, and infrastructure can help combat the loss of freedoms that occur after a disaster. Reducing inequalities, such as the possession of a mobile phone, in such an increasingly connected world, can help accelerate access to other freedoms, as well as disaster relief. Industry innovation and infrastructure would increase the efficiency of data collection and rescue movements before and after disasters, as well.

Rapid and Near Real-Time Assessments of Population Displacement Using Mobile Phone Data Following Disasters: The 2015 Nepal Earthquake. Retrieved September 15, 2020, from http://currents.plos.org/disasters/article/rapid-and-near-real-time-assessments-of-population-displacement-using-mobile-phone-data-following-disasters-the-2015-nepal-earthquake/

This article addressed displacement after the Gorkha earthquake (2015) in Nepal. After such high-impact disasters, like an earthquake, huge populations of people can be displaced by great distances: "On average, twenty-six million people per year." These populations, directly after being moved, are at high risks for injuries, starvation, and are in high need for support or rescue. They are the most vulnerable following disasters. Along with damage to physical buildings and structures, major infrastructure damages can slow rescue operations and lower the chance of survival. In regards to the 2015 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake, there was "severe degradation of Nepal's transport network" and many other damages led to large populations being secluded. Largely affected areas, including the "destruction of villages and town," also added to the displacement of populations. Furthermore, an estimated "2,600" government building had been completely obliterated with "3,700 more" damaged.  Coupled with weakened infrastructure, disaster response can become quite inefficient. Along with that,  when displaced, many people enter "informal settlements" or seek safety from families and friends, these people don't get follow-ups from aid and humanitarian organizations. 
But, after major disasters, timely data is hard to get a hold of. Current methods of tracking displacement "are slow and unreliable." What happens a lot of the time is that accurate data and analysis occurs and is distributed months after the actual disaster. For instance, four months after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, only then accurate data was sent out. This time frame is not logical for displaced populations to get rescue and support at an adequate rate. Another example of such a time-frame was after the 2011 New Zealand earthquake. Analyses and data of displacement through mobile data was "released 12 months after the earthquake." Another aspect to look at is the return of populations to their original homes. Often, when areas have not reached adequate recovery levels, their formal population will relocate and stay there. This can weaken data that is taken sometime after the disaster.  This infringes on people's freedom of protective security, and it can hinder one's chances of a long and healthy life. 
To combat the inefficiency of data collection and analyses after a disaster, the authors of the article proposed using cell phone data to estimate the displacement of populations. This is a tool that can be put to great use with the goal of industry, innovation, and infrastructure. The authors used CDR analysis to calculate and analyze the locations of different mobile users over Nepal. Using this data, they can answer the relative efficiency of "real-time" use of mobile data after major disasters.
 But even then, there are biases against certain groups. Between males and females, higher-income groups, and some age-specific groups, some are more likely to own a mobile phone than others. Furthermore, those without access to a cell phone whether due to their age, economic background, or location are not counted in the data and can be misrepresented. 

Bengtsson, L., Lu, X., Thorson, A., Garfield, R., & Schreeb, J. (2011, August 30). Improved Response to Disasters and Outbreaks by Tracking Population Movements with Mobile Phone Network Data: A Post-Earthquake Geospatial Study in Haiti.

This study explained how disaster response, regarding displaced populations, is neither reliable nor accurate in providing adequate data for rescue operations. When a population is displaced after a disaster, natural or man-made (terrorist attack), this can lead to large increases in morbidity and mortality of these populations. The displacements can also muddle with rescue and relief operations. Tracking these movements during past disasters had been slow and not very accurate in terms of getting people the help they need. The study examines the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Since there are no efficient and accurate data collecting methods for after a disaster, a lot of organizations rely on potentially biased methods. These can include eye witness accounts and aerial images. This study examines the efficiency of using mobile data to follow population movements and flows after a disaster. The researchers used the position of SIMs (subscriber identity modules), to get this data. Using ratios of people per mobile phone, the researchers were able to look at the movement of around 630,000 people. Within the two GSM mobile phone networks, the researchers worked with Digicel to see the data of 2.2 million people. They recorded 2.8 million SIMs and discussed estimations within the Port au Prince metropolitan area. Not only did they test this method after the earthquake, but with the cholera outbreak that occurred later that year. Using these methods, the researchers were able to prove that estimates of population movement can be accurately tracked and reported with mobile data use. With an increase in mobile phone ownership worldwide, this method can be useful in many regions of the world, especially those more vulnerable to natural disasters. This includes regions that are not fully developed or near a fault line for example. 
Though this method is proven useful, the researchers did imply that there are several limitations. However, in places that are more rural and have smaller populations, there are fewer cell phone towers. Since disasters can damage the towers, this method would prove utterly useless.  Furthermore, the researches explain that in more rural regions, mobile phone usage is lower among "children, the elderly, the poorest, and women." This can lead to a bias in the data, which is something the researchers are trying to avoid inc comparison to earlier methods. Moreover, in places where mobile phone access is low, there are fewer calls made, which leads to less precision in certain areas. 
But, as the researchers explain, with more freedom of protective security and social opportunities, this method may become more and more effective, and lead to progression in access to a long and healthy life.

This paper discussed the disaster management and response after the 2015 Nepal earthquake. The authors focused on three different datasets in response to the earthquake: the media coverage around the world, donations and contributions for relief, and the citizen's perception of the disaster response. 
When looking at the media coverage of the earthquake, the authors explain that after a spike on April 27th, there is a steep decrease. They present the idea that directly following the disaster, people's attention spiked, but soon began to leave. The authors also looked at events that occurred, such as public statements (mostly by the government), diplomatic events, and "additions of aid." This type of event decreased at a slower speed than other events showing that aid was a high priority. 
When looking at support from the globe, the authors looked at a GDELT dataset. This looked at five different types of aid: general, economic, military, humanitarian, from military and peacekeeping groups, and asylum. A delay in aid from the military can be put under "issues related to airport management and use." Otherwise, the authors showed that global attention led to most aid being contributed by others around the globe. To relate to media coverage, the authors also explained that when media attention was focused on military units, more aid was given. The authors looked even further at global aid. By comparing data from GDELT and Open Nepal ("a platform for sharing data related to Nepal"), they realized that the United States and the United Kingdom provided the most aid and along with that appeared in most of the media coverage. Going even further into specifics, the authors tracked where the aid was going. Looking at the distribution of funds, it can be seen that the Nepalese government focused on getting relief supplies and medical aids to victims. The government also focused on "minimizing disruption in education." They understood the effect an earthquake could have, and the government used it as an opportunity to teach safety and health; they focused on the dimension of access to education. 
Lastly, the authors looked at how Nepalese citizens reacted to the disaster response. They utilized citizen survey data and focused specifically on household construction; this is to give them an idea of how urgent the issue was for citizens. The authors noticed through their data comparison that though some regions were heavily damaged, they received less aid attention than needed or expected. This could lead to a flaw in the disaster management and response of the Nepalese government. The freedom of transparency guarantees is highly valuable after a disaster and the same goes for protective security. With the government applying aid where it is needed urgently, citizen approval would rise.

This article addressed the donations and support Nepal received following two major earthquakes. It focused on how global companies utilized Big Data to analyze current needs. The earthquake itself caused extensive damage through casualties, physical destruction, and development. 
When looking at donations, organizations such as the Red Cross and UNICEF worked within the country for on-ground support. Another way other global companies pitched in was through reduced costs. Microsoft, Google, AT&T, and more lowered the cost of communication to Nepal. Abbott, GSK, and Bristol Myers Squibbs also provided equipment and supplies to locate and aid displaced populations.  
Furthermore, the article goes to address how companies aided Nepal with the use of their data networks and Big Data. One example that the article listed was UPS activating their Logistics Emergency Team; this helped provide data in terms of shipping and distributions. It helped Nepal manage infrastructure when their transport system had been heavily damaged. Another example that the article looked at was Facebook. They activated their Safety Check which allowed people to post their status of safety. This allowed loved ones and friends from around the world to gain some peace of mind. Furthermore, it helped in the allocation of resources where they were most needed. Google also used its Person Finder. This allowed people to post about affected individuals. It took this data and created a database containing the status of victims around the country. As the article explains, these companies were able to use Big Data to provide more assistance and support to the individuals affected. These initiatives gave the population protective security and transparency guarantees. This helps push for a long and healthy life. 
Many volunteers, especially those associated with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and the Open Cities Project of Kathmandu Living Labs, utilized satellite imagery to provide more insight on where emergency responders were needed immediately. 
The author concludes that "the partnership of physical and digital resources is essential to an effective disaster recovery." By using Big Data, businesses were able to provide more timely and effective aid to those affected by the earthquake, Through monetary and service aid, data in humanitarian efforts help accelerate disaster response and management.
