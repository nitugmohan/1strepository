Effective disaster response for displaced populations in underdeveloped regions is critical for keeping morbidity and mortality rates low post-disaster. Especially with rapid movements of large amounts of people, infectious diseases such as Cholera and Ebola can become more lethal. Current methods, including transport surveys and “manual registration of individuals at emergency relief hubs,” are often slow and unreliable. They are inadequate at working efficiently during the direct aftermath and disorganization of a disaster. Usually, accurate data and analysis are completed and distributed many months after the actual disaster. Specifically looking at South Asia, Nepal’s response to the 2015 earthquake, the increase in floods in Southern India, which can lead to landslides, and Bangladesh's' vulnerability to climate change, there is a relevant and immediate need for efficiency in disaster response. Looking ahead, data usage for rescue operations and relief efforts can prove to be a major aid in increasing life expectancy, protective security, and transparency guarantees, as described by Amartya Sen.       

CDR data is looking to be a powerful contender. Utilizing call detail records, researchers can get a relative estimate of how people are moving. The data includes the location of the closest mobile phone tower at the time of each event; an "event" can be classified as a call, text message, or data download.  This type of data is regularly collected and stored by mobile network operators. In Nepal, when the 2015 earthquake damaged its infrastructure system, researchers utilized CDR analysis to calculate and analyze the locations of different mobile users. Using this data, they could estimate the relative efficiency of "real-time" use of mobile data after disasters.  The geospatial datasets that were utilized included 282 million calls from almost 3 million individual phones. The data was collected for a "period spanning six weeks before the disaster and five months after." When using this data, researchers had to comply with guidelines that were developed during the Ebola outbreak. The data was de-identified, meaning that "individual-level" data could not be accessed. With this data, the researchers were able to produce preliminary results just nine days after the earthquake and a full report nearly 2 weeks after. This analysis had brought data more efficiently than ever before. It allowed humanitarian agencies to identify where support was needed and which regions were not recovering as well as they had intended.    

Another method that is being looked at includes utilizing the integration of process-based modeling and Bayesian networks. These methods can help speed up the efficiency of a "process-based modeling approach," when forecasting storms. The data used for testing this approach was taken from a grouped set of datasets that deal with coastal flooding called SurgeWatch. In combination with "coastal aerial photography, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and bathymetric data from data archives," researchers can use this data to understand the severity of predicted floods and consequences to prepare for. This approach takes account of "spatial gradients both alongshore and cross-shore," and analyzing this data is very time-intensive and laborious. Though parallel processing is utilized to save time, the runtime of these programs can take multiple days. This is valuable time that forecasters and emergency responders cannot let go to waste in the presence of an incoming flood. Researchers and forecasters have now looked to Bayesian networks to cut down the runtime. They can train a Bayesian network on past flooding events; then, this data can be used to remove processing time that would otherwise be necessary for accurate results. This method also gives them the ability to integrate new factors that become available closer to the time of the storm's landfall.       
These are some of the data science methods being considered for efficient disaster response and forecasting.     

Climate vulnerability is a major factor in driving the need for efficient disaster response. This is especially true with the effects of climate change becoming more prevalent. Climate change can render places less habitable and productive, which will drive vulnerable populations to migrate from environmentally stressed areas. In southern India, the monsoon rains have ked to millions fleeing their homes and over a thousand deaths. This has happened consistently for over two years. In Kerala, there were 121 deaths and 83,000 in refuge relief camps. Very little rain fell in the first two months of the monsoon, but in the span of six days, 453.4 millimeters of rain were deposited. This intense deluge came from a monsoon depression; this is common during the monsoon season, but the intensity of the rain that fell in such a short time is unusual. The high variation in rainfall can complicate agriculture, access and availability to water supply, and endanger many to floods. This directly relates to the SDG of Clean Water and Sanitation. The Western Ghats will also receive higher-intensity rainfall because of climate change. Steep slopes push water-logged air upward, causing it to condense and rain out in tremendous volumes. With the floods and intense rainfall, there is also an increase in landslide risks. In Kerala, the rain triggered destructive landslides that killed 46 people. In the Western Ghats, over 3,000 landslides have occurred in the past two years from the intense rain. Furthermore, when looking at Bangladesh, they are at the frontline of climate vulnerability. The crowded and low-lying coastal areas are endangered by "frequent flooding from tropical cyclones and rising sea levels." With sea-levels rising at a rate faster than global averages it is expected that roughly 11 thousand km2 of land and 20.5 million people will be exposed to inundation risk by 2050. Even in the U.S., it was shown that "coastal flood losses could exceed the UD $1 trillion annually." Models have further shown that "up to 50 million additional people" could be at risk for flooding than those counted in 1990 figures. Many countries, especially in South Asia, do not even have enough resources to reach that dollar amount in disaster response and relief operations. Climate action is not only needed, but a detailed and efficient response to its effects is needed as well.       

Furthermore, an idea that I found interesting in my research was the relevance of transparency guarantees. With the efficient retrieval and analysis of data, responders and researchers can put out warnings and resources before the disaster even occurs. In the case of Cyclone Mahasen, which affected Bangladesh in 2013, "cyclone forecasting, early warnings and cyclone shelters providing refugee for affected populations have significantly lowered mortalities." But then the Forecasters' Dilemma comes into play. This considers the "trade-off" between finding and analyzing data and the need for timely and accurate predictions. As more time is spent analyzing and understanding the data, the more reliable a final output can be, such as evacuation or a stay at home order. Though, this can also increase the time in which this decision is too late to take adequate effect. But, if less time is taken and a "false warning" is put out, this can damage trust between society and forecasters; it can lead to a loss of transparency guarantees. This lack of trust can cause problems when decisions are not taken seriously. This will sometimes lead to high-risk behavior. Some of the behavior entailed by this includes that while cyclone shelters are pursued by some, others leave their homes late or not all, "in order to safeguard their property and assets." This is where data efficiency and transparency grantees integrate for good health and well-being.      

Multiple methods along with their own geospatial data sets have been referenced for this issue. One of the main ones being CDR data. This method of tracking and using cell phone data is highly relevant and efficient. This data can help in tracking the locations of large populations, especially those displaced by the disaster. Calls or texts are routed to nearby network towers. By recording that data and analyzing it, population movement can be tracked over time. CDRs, call detail records,  are the data points that hold the timestamp and network mast of an event; an event can be considered as receiving/making a call or sending/receiving a text message. This data is routinely collected and compiled by network operators; it allows researchers to map anonymous phones' journey regularly. The CDRs can provide a way to track population movement over time and aid rescue operations in locating displaced people. So far, evidence has shown that CDR-based mobility data provides the most current data for population movements in low and middle-income countries. For example, between 2011 and 2014, the proportion of households with at least one mobile phone rose from 78% to 89% with much of that growth concentrated among rural populations. This is an especially rich data source for climate-vulnerable populations. CDR data is also used to supplement "traditional survey-based methodologies with analysis of longitudinal high-resolution, individual-level mobility data, covering both local and national scales."     

In Bangladesh, two de-identified datasets from the largest mobile network operator, Grameenphone (GP), were analyzed. "Analyses were both done on the environmentally stressed areas in the Southern delta region of Bangladesh before and after Cyclone Mahasen, as well as on long-term national level migration patterns."  They focused on data from the primary impact zones of the cyclone. The other dataset included a "simple random sample of 1 million mobile phones drawn from the entire national set of mobile phones in the GP network." This spanned almost two years (Jan 1, 2012 - Nov 3, 2013) and includes the most frequently used mobile tower for each phone for each calendar month. When analyzing this data, the researchers had to filter it before completing a thorough analysis. This entailed removing subscribers who were not active before and after the cyclone while excluding those destroyed due to the cyclone or belonged to relief workers. The findings from this data emphasized how CDR data can help provide early warning and identify areas where high-risk behaviors are active. It allowed researchers to "quantify incidence, direction, and duration of migration episodes enabling characterization of previously undocumented features of long-term migration patterns in climate stressed areas."      

Another method that was looked at utilized Integrating process-based modeling and Bayesian networks. A lot of the time, when forecasting a storm, scientists will employ a "process-based modeling approach." This approach takes account of "spatial gradients both alongshore and cross-shore." Analyzing this data is very time-intensive and laborious. Though parallel processing is utilized to save time, runtimes can take multiple days. This is valuable time that forecasters and emergency responders cannot let go to waste. Some consequences of this could be that the storm/flood reaches humanity before processing is complete, or new factors change the output of the storm. Researchers and forecasters have now looked to Bayesian networks to cut down the runtime. They can train a Bayesian network on past flooding events; then, this data can be used to remove processing time that would otherwise be necessary for accurate results. This method also gives them the ability to integrate new factors that become available closer to the time of the storm's landfall. In Praia de Faro, Portugal, Bayesian networks were trained on "20 years of data," and accurately predicted "onshore erosion, overwash depth, and flow velocity." This analysis, if applied to South Asian countries and those in climate-vulnerable areas, could be hugely beneficial in early disaster response and relief.  
With more freedom of processive security and social opportunities, these methods may become more and more effective, and lead to progression in access to a long and healthy life. The freedom of transparency guarantees is highly valuable after a disaster and the same goes for protective security. “The partnership between physical and digital resources is essential to effective disaster recovery.”       

This area of human development and data science is not one I had expected to intersect nor that I would be investigating. I had always seen the two separately with different solutions; never really together. It was interesting looking back at my initial research and seeing how data usage in Haiti and Nepal led to disaster response in South Asian countries. But I did encounter a major gap in the bridge between these two. There is a lack of organized and intentional data collection for storm/flood consequences and climate change in these areas.  Though these methods have been applied, supplementing this data with CDR data would make findings that much more efficient and accurate. I would like to investigate what the probabilities are of collecting such data in rural areas that are more vulnerable to climate change.       

I think that data science can help us to better understand human development by placing a quantifying layer within the causes and effects of human development. It provides real methods and analysis to data, CDR data, or satellite imagery, for example, that gives the data meaning and specificity in its usage. It allows us to take a large set and narrow it down to a quantifiable level with specific reasonings. Complexity is at the very root of human development. Each region, issue, and system is unique in its way. Whether that be through policies, the economy, or social levels, no one problem is the same. Data science allows us to look at those specific details and provide a solution for that area.
