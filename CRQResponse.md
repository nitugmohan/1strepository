# CRQ Discussion
Research Question: As CDR data can build bias against those who do not own a mobile phone, women, poor, eldelry, etc., is it possible to quantify that bias in order to incorporate it into data analysis for disaster response in South Asian countries?     

Puzzle: Causal/ Predictive Puzzle - exploration of the influence of a particular factor or exploration of causes underlying an observed process - this type of question usually leads to quantitative research.      

Inquiry: Evaluative - seeks to grade or make judgement as to the effectiveness of a particular practice - explores the influence of a particular factor on another factor or explores causes underlying an observed phenomenon or process.     

Reasoning:       
As CDR data becomes more and more available, due to rising mobile phone ownership rates, it is also becoming more valuable for usage during disaster response. But, even then it has its own biases. It can exclude groups, forming a bias in the data. This bias creates a lower chance of rescue for women, poor, rural, young, and elderly. There is also bias between males and females, higher-income groups, and some age-specific groups, that are more likely to own a mobile phone than others. The exclusion of those not without a cellphone can impact the data to underestimate the amount of people affected by a disaster and lower their chance of survival. Furthermore, those without access to a cell phone whether due to their age, economic background, or location are not counted in the data and can be misrepresented.       
Utilizing an evaluative inquiry can help show how much impact this unprecedented bias can have on survival rates of those without a cellphone and where rescue resources are allocated. If certain groups do not receive enough resources to be rescued or are not given enough relief aid to build their communities back up, these groups can feel the effects of the disaster many years into the future. If bias is present in the data, it is in our best efforts to localize that bias and understand its influence on the rest of the data; it can have major impacts on decisions during disaster response and resource allocation.      

Sub-CRQs:      
1. Many times, one cellphone can represent multiple group/family members; is there a way to quantify that probability and incorporate it in the data?     
2. Looking at the after effects of the disaster, how well did the misrepresented groups recover in comparison to those with a cell phone?
