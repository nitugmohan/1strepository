## 9/3 Rosling & Sen- Q&A

What is the difference between western world and the 3rd world? Describe how Rosling talks about preconceived ideas and the difference.  
During Rosling’s talk, he explained an experiment he conducted with his students. He talked about how they viewed the world with a wester bias; we vs. them. This bias entailed that the west is more developed than any other part of the world. The students said that “we” have smaller families and longer lives, and “they” have larger families and shorter lives. But we know, from later in Rosling’s talk that this is not the case. One example he spoke about compared the U.S. and Vietnam. Vietnam went through a great social change that led to changes within the traditional family. This brought it much closer to what the U.S. had looked like previously.  
  
What is a precursor of wealth?   
Healthcare and education are some of the most important prerequisites to health. Rosling constable emphasizes this with  "you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first," and “You cannot buy health at the supermarket.” Investing in health and education by putting kids in school, training health staff, and educating the population can bring wealth to a country. Healthcare, rather than an expensive endeavor, is more of a labor/time intensive endeavour. It allocates huge resources of human capital, time, and labor. Rosling also uses the example of China, where they brought health first, and then wealth. Really, what is the value of wealth, if you don’t have the ability to move, energy, or food. Relating to Sen, it is the purest form of unfreedom. 

What is development?   
From Sen’s writing, development is a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy. It requires the removal of major sources of unfreedom, such as, poverty, tyranny, poor economic opportunities, systematic social deprivation, and neglect of public facilities. Sen moves away from a focus on GDP and monetary sources to a focus on the actual lives and freedoms that a human life needs: political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security, are some of the freedoms Sen discusses. 

What are some of the sources of unfreedoms, development requires the removal of? Why is free and sustainable agency a major engine of development?   
Some of the sources of unfreedoms that Sen lists are poverty, tyranny, poor economic opportunities, systematic social deprivation, neglect of public facilities, intolerance/overactivity of repressive states. Free and sustainable agency contributes to the strengthening of free agencies of other kinds. Universal solutions won’t work on distinctive problems. Similar to what Rosling mentioned in his talk, just within Africa, countries stand at different points of wealth and health. The same solutions would not work for all. 

What does Amartya say about being generally against markets and how there is similarity to freedom of speech?  
When Sen speaks about being generally against markets, he compares it to being generally against conversations between people. As freedom of speech is a natural right, Sen emphasizes that exchanging words, goods, or gifts is just part of life. “The freedom to participate in economic exchange has a basic role in living.” He discusses that markets are necessary for development and are just as important as freedom of speech. 

Who were Malthus and Condorcert?  
Condorcet was a great 18th-century french rationalist, and he expected the fertility rate to come down with “the progress of reason.” He believed that “greater security, more education, and more freedom of reflected decisions” would stop the growth of the population. On the other hand, Malthus, an 18th-century philosopher, disagreed with Condorcet. He argues that fertility rates will stay up if the resources to sustain it are there. It didn’t matter how educated the people were or the resources that they had; the population would keep expanding.
