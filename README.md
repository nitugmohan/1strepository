# Intro

Hi! My name is Nitu Girish Mohan, and I am a freshman at W&M. I am from Vienna, VA, and I am hoping to major in Data Science and Computer Science. I am excited to see where this class takes me!  

I have a little brother and a dog named Loki. I enjoy reading, running, and cooking/baking/trying new foods. I am excited for the upcoming year!
