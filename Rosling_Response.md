##Rosling Response

 
In Hans Rosling’s Tedx Talk, The best stats you’ve ever seen, Rosling discusses trends in health and economy for the world. Within the talk, Rosling reveals how the generalization of data can change one's perception of the world (his students in Sweden). With their perception of the so-called “split” in the world, they failed to realize that such a split is not as great as it is made to be. When he spoke about the countries within Africa, there is such a range in between and within countries, that using the same strategies for all will not work. “The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized.” Only with that high level of contextualization can countries reach heights (of the graph). Rosling emphasizes that it is “dangerous to use average data.” The average eliminates certain countries' individual needs or resources. This perception is one I had recently held myself until a course I took my senior year of high school highlighted similar inconsistencies for me. 

Considering precursors to wealth, the main development indicator that I noticed was health. Multiple times throughout his talk, Rosling emphasizes the value of health. As he talks about the speed of development that countries go through, he states "you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first." Even if countries, like the UAE, had wealth and resources, it would be very hard to sustain without health and education within its people. "Health cannot be bought at the supermarket." This line stuck with me because even if a country has wealth, without healthy people to sustain the economy, that wealth means nothing. Even when speaking about the leaders of China, health was brought first, then wealth. 

Along with health, another development indicator I discerned was education. Along with investing in health, the UAE invested in putting kids in schooling, training the health staff, and educating the population. Rosling also emphasized the use of the internet and the impact a "$100 computer" could have on development. Education could have a major impact on the economy and social structure of a country. From educating women about birth control (achieving that long life /few children lifestyle) to generating new ideas and resources, education can jumpstart a country's wealth.  

The data that Rosling is "liberating" could help data scientists and analysts predict changes a country might experience. This data could also aid a country in understanding what strategies need to be implemented where and how, as seen within African countries. I think that the "leveling" Rosling discussed can be accelerated and achieved with access to the UN data.
