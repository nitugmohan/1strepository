## 10/15 Owen Barder - Q&A
1. How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen's definition to include the idea of complexity?    

When looking at Amartya Sen’s definition, he focuses on how it “creates circumstances” for people to have “choices, capabilities, and freedoms.” In his podcast, Owen Barder refers to development as a property of the economic and social system. He says that it is better looked at as “a characteristic of the economic, social, and political system, not simply the sum of the well-being of the people in it”, as Sen might say. At the end of his talk, he says “emergence of systemic change and self‐organising complexity which is what we call development.”   


2. Who was Thomas Thwaites and what was his "toaster project"?  Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of Barder's talk about complexity and development?    

Thomas Thwaites was a British design student and his “toaster project” was an attempt to produce a working toaster entirely from scratch (raw ingredients.) He was successful to the extent that the toaster worked for “five seconds, and then it burst into flames.” What Border was trying to say with this project is that, though a toaster may be such a simple object that we don’t think about very often, it has a variety of intricate and complex parts. He uses that description and applies it to the idea that an increase in one firm is inconsequential when compared against the “emergence of a system of economic , financial, legal, social and political institutions, firms, products and technologies.” You need multiple products and services in order to build one thing, such as a workforce, a transportation system, a legal system etc, and along with those things, you need an adequate economy to supply all those goods. All the multiple functioning parts to a complex system.    


3. Barder compared the economic growth of South Korea and Ghana between 1960 and 2010. Why was this example instructive as part of his talk?  What did this comparison demonstrate when used as the basis to validate (or invalidate) economic models?   

When Barder compared the economic growth of South Korea and Ghana, he showed that in 1960, they had roughly the same income per person. But in the late 1970s, South Korea’s income took off, and Ghana’s stayed the same. He then presented the question: “why has this happened in South Korea but not Ghana?” This example was instructive as part of his talk, because he utilized it to invalidate economic models that did not present a reason for his question. He utilized it to show that the Harrod - Domar model could not produce an explanation as to why South Korea started doing so well. He said that the model “bears no resemblance to reality,” because it only looked at “figures for capital and labour.”   


4. What was the Harrod-Domar model? What are the two fundamental variables in this model? Who was Walter Rostow and what was the impact of his work on development?  Was the Harrod-Domar model effective at predicting development outcomes?     

The Harrod-Domar model was a simple model that said “to make a unit of output… you need to combine a certain amount of capital...and a certain amount of labour.” It stated that “a firm increases its output if it can increase the amount of capital it uses and the amount of labor it uses.” The two fundamental variables in this model are capital and amount of labour. The Harrod-Domar model was not effective in predicting development outcomes in that “it bears no resemblance to reality.” You cannot look at just capital and labour to try and understand the reasoning behind Ghana and South Korea
Walter Rostow is an author who published The Stages of Economic Growth. He said that “development is a virtuous circle: when investment rises, that means that the capital stock rises, so output rises, leading to higher incomes, more savings, and so more investment.” His model was “hugely influential,” in that it said that once you know how much investment you need, foreign aid can be calculated to get that amount and that this would “launch the country into ‘self-sustained growth.’” 


5. What was the Robert Solow model and how did it address the limitations of the Harrod-Domar model? Was this model successful as predicting economic growth?    

Robert Solow’s model is known as the “neoclassical growth model.” Where the Harrod-Domar model only looked at capital and labour, this model introduces “technical change.” He did not define this component, but rather referred to it as a “magic ingredient which, when combined with labour and capital, increases the output of each firm.” This model fits the data better than the Harrod-Domar model, but it is not a model; it just breaks down growth into 3 different components, including one that is never defined.   


6. What was the Washington Consensus? How did it propose to improve upon models of economic growth? Success or Failure?   
 
The Washington Consensus was a  series of ten policy reforms that were proposed by institutions like the Work Bank and the IMF. By most, the consensus was seen as a failure in that “efforts to free up markets” did not help countries in what they had expected. Particularly in the case of the Ajaokuta Steel Works in Nigeria, it showed that the Consensus was not effective. But, it did have some positive outcomes, especially in sub Saharan Africa where “bringing down pubic deficits and liberalising exchange rates, may have helped to improve economic performance.”   


7. What was the Ajaokuta Steel Works? How did it illustrate the transition from a focus on policies to institutions.  How productive has the Nigerian steel works proven to be?    

The Ajaokuta Steel Works in Nigeria is one “of the largest ever investments in steel production anywhere in the world.” But it has so far “produced no steel at all.” Though economic models had predicted it would grow, it suffered under “poor management and endemic corruption.” When people realized that the Washington Consensus was not working, they said the “problem was not policies but institutions.” Even then, massive amounts of money put into the steel works was wasted.   


8. Who was Haile Sellasie? What is the significance of Kapuscinski's book the Emperor? How did Ethiopia exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change? Do you agree with Barder's interpretation?   

Haile Sellasie was the emperor of the last feudal dynasty of Ethiopia. The book used a combination of historical accounts and fictional narrative to portray how “all questions came from the top down.” The emperor was blind to “poverty and starvation” in the country. This regime extracted “economic value” from their people and suppressed any “efforts to move towards more inclusive political and social institutions.” It gets people stuck in a “poverty trap.” He used this dynamic to provide emphasis on the resource curse. I think it is iterating interpretation, and it provides a different insight into a barrier of development.


9. Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at Unilever? Was he successful? How significant were his results?     

Steve Jones is a famous evolutionary biologist. He helped produce a nozzle that would be more efficient in producing soap powder. He took the current model, and made ten copies that were distorted in one way. He took the best nozzle of those ten and repeated the process until forty-five generations later, he produced the best nozzle. It was majorly successful, and it showed that “adaptive change” can bring about “startling, game‐changing jumps to new solutions.” The use of evolution produced the best output possible. The new nozzle was hundred of times more effective than any previous model.   


10. What is the significance of Schumpeter's idea of creative destruction? How does it relate to firms and industries?     

Schumpeter’s idea of creative destruction shows how firms adapt to today’s needs and wants. Barder uses the example of Nokia. He shows that their transition from manufacturing of tyres and rubber boots to telecommunication was majorly successful. But it also showed that their lack of transitioning to smartphones, adapting to the current environment, could be a major part of their downfall. Creative destruction shows why as firms adapt to today’s environment, firms that fail to do so fall out of business.     


11. Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? Does he suggest a different approach?  What did he mean by his use of the term, iso-morphic mimicry?    

Iso-morphic mimicry showed that it is sometimes easier to put on a facade than to actually have that ability. Barder uses the example of animals having a more dangerous appearance than they actually are. The same thing can be applied to organizations like a police force. Barder recommends resisting engineering and instead embracing experimentation.    


12. What did Barder mean by “resist fatalism”? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?     

What Barder means by “resist fatalism” is that we should not “accept whatever outcome the process of evolution gives us.” If we know things will get better with evolution, we should try to “accelerate and shape evolution.” Norman Borlaug is “the man who brought about the Green Revolution by intervening in the evolutionary process to develop high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties.” This revolution “saved more than a billion people round the world from starvation.” He is a direct example of resisting fatalism; he played with the evolution of wheat until he achieved the best varieties for him.
